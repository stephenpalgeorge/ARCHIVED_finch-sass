# Pseudo Module 

The *Finch Pseudo Module* handles everything to do with css pseudo classes and pseudo elements. The pseudo module alone should give you all the tools you need to style states like `hover`, `focus` etc and elements like `before` and `after`. This document outlines the mixins and functions that this module exposes.
